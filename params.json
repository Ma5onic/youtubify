If you already know how to do this/or have already created one just skip to the next step.\r\n\r\nYour host will most likely be running **phpMyAdmin** as mysql manager, if that's the case here's a step by step guide (if not the proccess will be very similar on other managers).\r\n\r\nLogin to your control panel, find and click phpMyAdmin link: ![][1] \r\n\r\nClick on the database tab in the top menu, enter any name you like and click create.![][2]\r\n\r\n## Uploading Files\r\n\r\nAfter creating a database, unzpip the .zip file you donwloaded and upload the **contents** of **Youtubify** folder to your servers root folder (usually called www or html or something similar) or a sub-directory, shared hosting providers usually have a web based file manager, but you should use something like [Filezilla][3] to do the upload as the web based managers can cause various problems fairly often.\r\n\r\nMake sure that **application/storage** and all the **sub-folders** are writable by your server (have 777 permissions if you are on shared hosting). You can change files and folders permissions by right-clicking them in the filemanager, clicking file permissions, and then entering 777 in the permissions field.\r\n\r\n## Installing Youtubify\r\n\r\nAfter you uploaded Youtubify files, simply open up your site url and follow on-screen instructions to finish the installation.\r\n\r\n![][4]\r\n\r\n## Updating **Youtubify** to new versions\r\n* 1\\. Extract the .zip file you downloaded.\r\n* 2\\. Upload and overwrite all the files same way you did when you installed Youtubify.\r\n* 3\\.

Mandrill is used to avoid the many problems that occur when using public smtp servers (like gmail or your hostings private one). Here's how to get your API key.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use SMTP instead (or one of the other available options), go to **admin area &gt; settings &gt; mail** and simply change mandrill to another option and enter any other required details like host, usernamer, password etc.\r\n\r\n### Register for mandrill api key\r\n\r\nTo register for mandrill key go to this [url][23], create a new account and then log in.

It's the same ID as for google social login so refer to documenation on social login to see how to get that key.

You can now easily view analytics information right from the admin area. You can also select different analytics account, property and view from the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n![][35]\r\n\r\n## Appearence\r\n\r\nFrom appearence page you can modify how your site looks by changing colors, fonts, sizes and more. Simply change the value in the field you want and click **save** on the right. Youtubify will compile a custom css stylesheet (just as if it was written by a programmer!) without you needing to have any coding knowledge. Original stylesheet will be preserved so you can switch back at any time. You can also create multiple stylesheets(light, dark etc) and switch them at any time from panel on the left. You can also insert custom css, by typing it into custom css panel.\r\n\r\nNote that **variables** and **functions** might sometimes be used in some of the appearence fields. These are very simple to understand. For example, by default **main background color** is **lighten($main-color, 5%)**, this simply means that it will take the color value from $main-color field in appearence page (#19191b by default) and make that color 5% lighter.\r\n\r\n![][36]\r\n\r\n## Translations\r\n\r\nYou can translate youtubify right from the admin area so there's no need to mess with configuration files or 3rd party applications. Simpley open translations page and enter your translation for a particular line under **translation** column in the table.\r\n\r\nNote that while you can translate the original (englsish) locale, it is recommended to create a new one (frome the panel on the left) so you don't need to worry about overwriting it with future updates.\r\n\r\n![][37]\r\n\r\n## Users\r\n\r\nFrom users page, you can get an overview of your site users, create a new one, delete existing ones and edit their profile information.\r\n\r\n![][38]\r\n\r\n## Settings\r\n\r\nOn the settings page you can change various options on your site from your homepage view to user registration. There's a description under each options so you shouldn't have any troubles figuring out which setting does what.\r\n\r\n![][39]\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems or questions, please contact me here [https://github.com/kumaranvpl/][40], thanks!\r\n\r\n[1]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/db_ex_2.png\r\n[2]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/db_ex_3.png\r\n[3]: https://filezilla-project.org/\r\n[4]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/install_ex_1.png\r\n[5]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/api_keys_ex_1.png\r\n[6]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/youtube_key_ex_1.png\r\n[7]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/youtube_key_ex_2.png\r\n[8]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/youtube_key_ex_3.png\r\n[9]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/echonest_key_ex_1.png\r\n[10]: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/register\r\n[11]: https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/#!/applications/create\r\n[12]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/spotify_ex_1.png\r\n[13]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/social_ex_5.png\r\n[14]: https://developers.facebook.com/\r\n[15]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/facebook_ex_1.png\r\n[16]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/social_ex_1.png\r\n[17]: https://dev.twitter.com/apps/new\r\n[18]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/twitter_ex_1.png\r\n[19]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/social_ex_2.png\r\n[20]: https://cloud.google.com/console/project\r\n[21]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/google_ex_1.png\r\n[22]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/social_ex_3.png\r\n[23]: https://mandrill.com/signup/\r\n[24]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/mandrill_ex_1.png\r\n[25]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/mandrill_ex_2.png\r\n[26]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/mandrill_ex_3.png\r\n[27]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/assets/images/mandrill_ex_4.png\r\n[28]: https://www.google.com/analytics/web/\r\n[29]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/analytics_ex_1.png\r\n[30]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/analytics_ex_2.png\r\n[31]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/analytics_ex_3.png\r\n[32]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/analytics_ex_6.png\r\n[33]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/analytics_ex_7.png\r\n[34]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/analytics_ex_5.png\r\n[35]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/analytics_ex_4.png\r\n[36]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/appearence_ex_1.png\r\n[37]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/translations_ex_1.png\r\n[38]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/users_ex_1.png\r\n[39]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kumaranvpl/youtubify/master/documentation/assets/images/settings_ex_1.png\r\n[40]: https://github.com/kumaranvpl/","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
